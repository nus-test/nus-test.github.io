The vagueness and intricacy of the SQL specification make it difficult to model the semantics of queries, making it challenging to test the correctness and performance of DBMSs. Traditional approaches, such as metamorphic testing, require precise modeling of the SQL specification to create different inputs with equivalent semantics. This process can be labor-intensive and error-prone. To address this, we propose Mozi, a framework that finds DBMS bugs via configuration-based equivalent transformation. The key idea behind Mozi is to compare the results of equivalent DBMSs with different configurations, rather than between semantically equivalent queries. The framework involves analyzing the query plan, changing configurations to transform the DBMS to an equivalent one, and re-executing the query to compare the results using various test oracles. For example, detecting differences in query results indicates correctness bugs, while observing faster execution times on the optimization-closed DBMS suggests performance bugs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mozi by evaluating it on four widely used DBMSs, namely MySQL, MariaDB, Clickhouse, and PostgreSQL. In the continuous fuzzing, Mozi totally found 101 previously unknown bugs, including 49 correctness and 52 performance bugs in four DBMSs. Among them, 90 bugs are confirmed and 57 bugs have been fixed. In addition, Mozi can be extended to other DBMS fuzzers for testing various types of bugs. With Mozi, testing DBMSs becomes simpler and more effective, potentially saving time and effort that would otherwise be spent on precisely modeling SQL specifications for testing purposes.\n\n Bio: Jie Liang received the B.S. degree in computer science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2017, and the Ph.D. degree in software engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2022.

Most of them become crucial components in the realm of data management,providing a systematic approach to identify and capture changes made to data over and across databases. However, the correctness of CDC tools is not guaranteed like DBMS, and the bugs in CDC tools may lead to severe consequences. Existing techniques such as fuzzing and differential testing are generally used to test DBMS. Approaches to find logic bugs, such as when a DBMS computes an incorrect result set, lead to automatically generate tools like SQLancer. SQLancer has been used to find bugs in a range of widely-used, production-quality DBMS including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL. However, these techniques are not well used in finding bugs inside CDC tools. The key conceptual challenge was to tackle the test oracle and test-case generation problems together with heterogeneous databases connected by CDC tools. In this talk, I will introduce the study of testing CDC tools via SQLancer-CDC, a tool for automatic testing of database management systems together with change data capture tool chain.

Most such fuzzing techniques have taken a blackbox approach, with compilers and code analysers starting to become relatively immune to such fuzzers. We propose a coverage-directed, mutation-based approach for fuzzing C compilers and code analysers, inspired by the success of this type of greybox fuzzing in other application domains. The main challenge of applying mutation-based fuzzing in this context is that naive mutations are likely to generate programs that do not compile. Such programs are not useful for finding deep bugs that affect optimisation, analysis, and code generation routines. We have designed a novel greybox fuzzer for C compilers and analysers by developing a new set of mutations to target common C constructs, and transforming fuzzed programs so that they produce meaningful output, allowing differential testing to be used as a test oracle, and paving the way for fuzzer-generated programs to be integrated into compiler and code analyser regression test suites. We have implemented our approach in GrayC, a new opensource LibFuzzer-based tool, and present experiments showing that it provides more coverage on the middle- and back-end stages of compilers and analysers compared to other mutation-based approaches, including Clang-Fuzzer, PolyGlot, and a technique similar to LangFuzz. We have used GrayC to identify 30 confirmed compiler and code analyser bugs: 25 previously unknown bugs (with 22 of them already fixed in response to our reports) and 5 confirmed bugs reported independently shortly before we found them. A further 3 bug reports are under investigation. Apart from the results above, we have contributed 24 simplified versions of coverage-enhancing test cases produced by GrayC to the Clang/LLVM test suite, targeting 78 previously uncovered functions in the LLVM codebase.","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"GrayC: Greybox Fuzzing of Compilers and Analysers for C","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jun Lyu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1700488800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700488800,"objectID":"0cf2dc08ebe30a9dcd62da1d2a0475f5","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/231120/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/231120/","section":"event","summary":"Complete and correct build dependencies are critical to successful builds and are often violated and ignored by practitioners using MAKE, one of the widely used build systems.

We propose an automated testing approach based on a state-machine model, enabling the automatic generation of test cases specifically designed to differentially test various JDBC drivers. Thus, the key conceptual challenge was to tackle the so-called test oracle and test-case generation problems.

The primary findings of this research effort include the discovery of two bugs within the DuckDB JDBC driver, which were subsequently verified and confirmed by the developers. Additionally, the study has unearthed several previously unnoticed discrepancies in the behaviors exhibited by various JDBC drivers.

To prevent bugs from being introduced, DBMS developers have implemented extensive test suites; for example, the SQLite test suites contain over 92 million lines of code. Despite these extensive efforts, test suites are not systematically reused across DBMSs, leading to wasted effort. Integration is challenging, as test suites use various test case formats and rely on unstandardized test runner features. We present a unified test suite, SQuaLity, in which we integrated test cases from three widely-used DBMSs, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and DuckDB. In addition, we present an empirical study to determine the potential of reusing these systems’ test suites. Our results indicate that reusing test suites is challenging: First, test formats and test runner commands vary widely; for example, SQLite has 4 test runner commands, while MySQL has 112 commands with additional features, to, for example, execute file operations or interact with a shell. Second, while some test suites contain mostly standard-compliant statements (e.g., 99% in SQLite), other test suites mostly test non-standardized functionality (e.g., 31% of statements in the PostgreSQL test suite are non-standardized). Third, test reuse is complicated by various explicit and implicit dependencies, such as the need to set variables and configurations, certain test cases requiring extensions not present by default, and query results depending on specific clients. Despite the above findings, we have identified 3 crashes, 3 hangs, and multiple compatibility issues across four different DBMSs by executing test suites across DBMSs, indicating the benefits of reuse. Overall, this work represents the first step towards test-case reuse in the context of DBMSs, and we believe that practitioners will benefit from SQuaLity as a practical tool.","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"Reusing Test Suites Across Database Systems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Shaohua Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697464800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697464800,"objectID":"3fb5d45a3316f888008e1b5f506bb859","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/231016/","publishdate":"2023-10-16T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/231016/","section":"event","summary":"Shaohua Li is a last-year Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. Zhendong Su.

Deriving an efficient query plan is challenging, and both academia and industry have invested decades into researching query optimization. Despite this, DBMSs are prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query plan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a longstanding problem and inherently difficult, because no ground truth information on an expected execution time exists. In this work, we propose Cardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT), a novel technique that detects performance issues through the lens of cardinality estimation. Given a query on a database, CERT derives a more restrictive query (e.g., by replacing a LEFT JOIN with an INNER JOIN), whose estimated number of rows should not exceed the number of estimated rows for the original query. CERT tests cardinality estimators specifically, because they were shown to be the most important component for query optimization; thus, we expect that finding and fixing such issues might result in the highest performance gains. In addition, we found that some other kinds of query optimization issues are exposed by the unexpected cardinality estimation, which can also be detected by CERT. CERT is a black-box technique that does not require access to the source code; DBMSs expose query plans via the EXPLAIN statement. CERT eschews executing queries, which is costly and prone to performance fluctuations. We evaluated CERT on three widely used and mature DBMSs, MySQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB. CERT found 13 unique issues, of which 2 issues were fixed and 9 confirmed by the developers. We expect that this new angle on finding performance bugs will help DBMS developers in improving DMBSs' performance.","tags":null,"title":"Finding Performance Issues in Database Engines via Cardinality Estimation Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"c63fd5d556f584402273a2298ea71981","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/23-10-10-cert-icse24/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-10-10-cert-icse24/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Finding Performance Issues in Database Engines via Cardinality Estimation Testing\" was accepted at ICSE'24!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Wenjing Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696860000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696860000,"objectID":"8f14f5fb5a920795472238f9605ca933","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/231009/","publishdate":"2023-10-09T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/231009/","section":"event","summary":"We propose a testing framework for validating static typing procedures in compilers.

Instead of acquiring human annotations, ODAO first generates weak labels for unannotated corpus by employing rules-based on universal dependency parsing. Then, ODAO utilizes this weak supervision to train a double-layer span extraction framework to extract aspect terms (ATE), opinion terms (OTE), and aspect-opinion pairs (AOPE). ODAO applies canonical correlation analysis as an early stopping indicator to avoid the model over-fitting to the noise to tackle the noisy weak supervision. ODAO applies a self-training process to gradually enrich the training data to tackle the weak supervision bias issue. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the power of the proposed ODAO. The results on four benchmark datasets for aspect-opinion co-extraction and pair extraction tasks show that ODAO can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods.","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining with Double-Layer Span Extraction","type":"event"},{"authors":["Qiyuan Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677506400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677506400,"objectID":"cf6a2ac1f53899783b37325365c25146","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/230227/","publishdate":"2023-02-27T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/230227/","section":"event","summary":"Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is an effective paradigm for testing highly configurable systems, and its goal is to generate a t-wise covering array (CA) as a test suite, where t is the strength of testing. It is recognized that pairwise testing (i.e., CIT with t=2) is the most common CIT technique, and has high fault detection capability in practice. The problem of pairwise CA generation (PCAG), which is a core problem in pairwise testing, aims at generating a pairwise CA (i.e., 2-wise CA) of minimum size, subject to hard constraints. The PCAG problem is a hard combinatorial optimization problem, which urgently requires practical methods for generating pairwise CAs (PCAs) of small sizes. However, existing PCAG algorithms suffer from the severe scalability issue; that is, when solving large-scale PCAG instances, existing state-of-the-art PCAG algorithms usually cost a fairly long time to generate large PCAs, which would make the testing of highly configurable systems both ineffective and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective sampling-based approach dubbed SamplingCA for solving the PCAG problem. SamplingCA first utilizes sampling techniques to obtain a small test suite that covers valid pairwise tuples as many as possible, and then adds a few more test cases into the test suite to ensure that all valid pairwise tuples are covered. Extensive experiments on 125 public PCAG instances show that our approach can generate much smaller PCAs than its state-of-the-art competitors, indicating the effectiveness of SamplingCA. Also, our experiments show that SamplingCA runs one to two orders of magnitude faster than its competitors, demonstrating the efficiency of SamplingCA. Our results confirm that SamplingCA is able to address the scalability issue and considerably pushes forward the state of the art in PCAG solving.","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"SamplingCA: Effective and Efficient Sampling-Based Pairwise Testing for Highly Configurable Software Systems","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677110400,"objectID":"b585acf372dbadd8873cf600ed78b7b0","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/23-02-23-distinguishedaward-icse23/","publishdate":"2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-02-23-distinguishedaward-icse23/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance\" received \"ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award\" at ICSE'23!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676901600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676901600,"objectID":"4bcaa25d8a60bb97e1c3a4acef0d1911","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/230220/","publishdate":"2023-02-20T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/230220/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"Finding Optimization Bugs in Datalog Engines","type":"event"},{"authors":["Albert Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676293200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676293200,"objectID":"15096ab7fc7dde9b52937ae5d6b39242","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/230213/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/230213/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"General SQL Grammar for Testing Case Generation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jinsheng Ba"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675688400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675688400,"objectID":"83db2006d1013b61e24c8759837180d3","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/230206/","publishdate":"2023-02-06T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/230206/","section":"event","summary":"Database Management Systems (DBMSs) process a given query by creating an execution plan, which is subsequently executed, to compute the query's result. Deriving an efficient query plan is challenging, and both academia and industry have invested decades into researching query optimization. Despite this, DBMSs are prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query plan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a longstanding problem and inherently difficult, because no ground truth information on an expected execution time exists. In this work, we propose Cardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT), a novel technique that detects performance issues through the lens of cardinality estimation. Given a query on a database, CERT derives a more restrictive query (e.g., by replacing a LEFT JOIN with an INNER JOIN), whose estimated number of rows should not exceed the number of estimated rows for the original query. CERT tests cardinality estimators specifically, because they were shown to be the most important component for query optimization; thus, we expect that finding and fixing such issues might result in the highest performance gains. In addition, we found that some other kinds of query optimization issues are exposed by the unexpected cardinality estimation, which can also be detected by CERT. CERT is a black-box technique that does not require access to the source code; DBMSs expose query plans via the EXPLAIN statement. CERT eschews executing queries, which is costly and prone to performance fluctuations. We evaluated CERT on three widely used and mature DBMSs, MySQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB. CERT found 13 unique issues, of which 2 issues were fixed and 9 confirmed by the developers. We expect that this new angle on finding performance bugs will help DBMS developers in improving DMBSs' performance.","tags":["Weekly Talk"],"title":"Cardinality Estimation Testing","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672876800,"objectID":"3d5b9eaa0f8b340803c484e9a1c0ad81","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/23-01-05-researchaward-jinsheng/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-01-05-researchaward-jinsheng/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Jinsheng Ba received a \"Research Achievement Award\" from School of Computing!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"6689cfd9f4ecef2ebf0beda866702603","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/22-12-09-qpg-icse23/","publishdate":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-12-09-qpg-icse23/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance\" was accepted at ICSE'23!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jinsheng Ba","Manuel Rigger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"ff85067ccb75b9add56fa65f371f35bb","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2023-icse-qpg/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-icse-qpg/","section":"publication","summary":"Database systems are widely used to store and query data. Test oracles have been proposed to find logic bugs in such systems, that is, bugs that cause the database system to compute an incorrect result. To realize a fully automated testing approach, such test oracles are paired with a test case generation technique; a test case refers to a database state and a query on which the test oracle can be applied. In this work, we propose the concept of Query Plan Guidance (QPG) for guiding automated testing towards \"interesting\" test cases. SQL and other query languages are declarative. Thus, to execute a query, the database system translates every operator in the source language to one of potentially many so-called physical operators that can be executed; the tree of physical operators is referred to as the query plan. Our intuition is that by steering testing towards exploring diverse query plans, we also explore more interesting behaviors—some of which are potentially incorrect. To this end, we propose a mutation technique that gradually applies promising mutations to the database state, causing the DBMS to create diverse query plans for subsequent queries. We applied our method to three mature, widely-used, and extensively-tested database systems—SQLite, TiDB, and CockroachDB—and found 53 unique, previously unknown bugs. Our method exercises 4.85—408.48× more unique query plans than a naive random generation method and 7.46× more than a code coverage guidance method. Since most database systems—including commercial ones—expose query plans to the user, we consider QPG a generally applicable, black-box approach and believe that the core idea could also be applied in other contexts (e.g., to measure the quality of a test suite).","tags":null,"title":"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Kamm","Manuel Rigger","Chengyu Zhang","Zhendong Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"c33260c2c9eac0e9ce2084d526f8229a","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2023-issta-gdbmeter/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-issta-gdbmeter/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph Database Management Systems (GDBMSs) store data as graphs and allow the efficient querying of nodes and their relationships. Logic bugs are bugs that cause a GDBMS to return an incorrect result for a given query (e.g., by returning incorrect nodes or relationships). The impact of such bugs can be severe, as they often go unnoticed. The core insight of this paper is that Query Partitioning, a test oracle that has been proposed to test Relational Database Systems, is applicable to testing GDBMSs as well. The core idea of Query Partitioning is that, given a query, multiple queries are derived whose results can be combined to reconstruct the given query’s result. Any discrepancy in the result indicates a logic bug. We have implemented this approach as a practical tool named GDBMeter and evaluated GDBMeter on three popular GDBMSs and found a total of 41 unique, previously unknown bugs. We consider 14 of them to be logic bugs, the others being error or crash bugs. Overall, 27 of the bugs have been fixed, and 35 confirmed. We compared our approach to the state-of-the-art approach to testing GDBMS, which relies on differential testing; we found that it results in a high number of false alarms, while Query Partitioning reported actual logic bugs without any false alarms. Furthermore, despite the previous efforts in testing Neo4j and JanusGraph, we found 13 additional bugs. The developers appreciate our work and plan to integrate GDBMeter into their testing process.

Often, a single logical refactoring change involves changing multiple related components in a source base such as renaming each occurrence of a variable or function. While many code editors can perform such common and generic refactorings, they do not support more complex refactorings or those that are specific to a given code base. For those, as a flexible — albeit less interactive — alternative, developers can write refactoring scripts that can implement arbitrarily complex logic by manipulating the program's tree representation. In this work, we present Forest, a structural code editor that aims to bridge the gap between the interactiveness of code editors and the expressiveness of refactoring scripts. While structural editors have occupied a niche as general code editors, the key insight of this work is that they enable a novel structural multi-cursor design that allows Forest to reach a similar expressiveness as refactoring scripts; Forest allows to perform a single action simultaneously in multiple program locations and thus support complex refactorings. To support interactivity, Forest provides features typical for text code editors such as writing and displaying the program through its textual representation. Our evaluation demonstrates that Forest allows performing edits similar to those from refactoring scripts, while still being interactive. We attempted to perform edits from 48 real-world refactoring scripts using Forest and found that 11 were possible, while another 17 would be possible with added features. We believe that a multi-cursor setting plays to the strengths of structural editing, since it benefits from reliable and expressive. Our results suggest that multi-cursor structural editors could be practical for performing small-scale specialized refactorings.","tags":null,"title":"Forest: Structural Code Editing with Multiple Cursors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Rigger","Zhendong Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"eca017828c70a5a478ad171c1351cdd5","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2022-onward-intramorphic/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-onward-intramorphic/","section":"publication","summary":"A test oracle determines whether a system behaves correctly for a given input.

In this paper, we propose a new approach, called meta bug detection, which offers three crucial advantages over existing learning-based bug detectors: bug-type generic (i.e., capable of catching the types of bugs that are totally unobserved during training), self-explainable (i.e., capable of explaining its own prediction without any external interpretability methods) and sample efficient (i.e., requiring substantially less training data than standard bug detectors). Our extensive evaluation shows our meta bug detector (MBD) is effective in catching a variety of bugs including null pointer dereference, array index out-of-bound, file handle leak, and even data races in concurrent programs; in the process MBD also significantly outperforms several noteworthy baselines including Facebook Infer, a prominent static analysis tool, and FICS, the latest anomaly detection method.","tags":["group meeting"],"title":"Infrared: A Meta Bug Detector","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jinsheng Ba"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663246800,"objectID":"1c7749c904bb50b317c36b8adc27d0fa","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/event/220915/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/220915/","section":"event","summary":"Greybox fuzzing is a proven effective testing method for the detection of security vulnerabilities and other bugs in modern software systems. Greybox fuzzing can also be used in combination with a sanitizer, such as AddressSanitizer (ASAN), to further enhance the detection of certain classes of bug such as buffer overflow and use-after-free errors. However, sanitizers also introduce additional performance overheads, and this can degrade the performance of greybox fuzzing---measured in the order of 2.36x for fuzzing with ASAN---potentially negating the benefit of using a sanitizer in the first place. Recent research attributes this to extra overheads to additional page faults that are generated when the disjoint sanitizer metadata is accessed at runtime.\nIn this paper, we present a new design that can detect memory errors without a proliferation of page faults. The basic idea is to track memory validity using randomized tokens that are stored directly in the memory itself, rather than in disjoint metadata. All read/write operations are instrumented to check for the token, and if present, a memory error will be detected. We implement our design in the form of the ReZZan---a sanitizer specifically optimized for fuzz testing. Since there is no disjoint metadata access, no additional page faults are generated, minimizing the performance overhead to around 1.14-1.27x (depending on the configuration).","tags":["group meeting"],"title":"Efficient Fuzzing to Detect Memory Errors","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Check out his website at https://ch1zhang.github.io/.\n","date":1661385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661385600,"objectID":"14108c62211665cd9d1c9a0bb445b1c1","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/22-08-25-chi/","publishdate":"2022-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-08-25-chi/","section":"post","summary":"Check out his website at https://ch1zhang.github.io/.","tags":null,"title":"Chi Zhang, a PhD student at Nanjing University, is visiting the lab for one year.
